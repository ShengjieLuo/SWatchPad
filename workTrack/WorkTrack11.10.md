Up till now, we have done following work

#PSK Audio Singnal and Processing
##Work Have Done
* We have modulated simple waves into PSK waves of 3 different frequency options 
* We have established both the hardware environment and software environment in smart phone.
* We have tested the playing and recording of the mobile phone. Now we can record the wav file and then analysis it.
* We completed the frequency analysis of PSK wave. It is found that the PSK wave donot change the frequency.

##Work on Track
* We are now demodulating（解调） the audio signal into digital signal. 
The work is scheduled on Friday, and we are sure that we can accomplish it.
* We planed to calculate the absolute distance by PSK ToA (TIme of Arrival)
Note: This distance is in 1D, just a base of the 2D distance calculation.
The work is scheduled on Friday, and we would attempt to finish it before weekend.

##Work in plan
* The PSK is used to get the 2D distance. However, we still have some hardware limitation. 
This topic should be discussed and decided in Friday. And the hardware improvent would be assigned to BO in this weekend. 
* The mathmatical solution of 2D distance measuring is not avaliable. It's a sort of math problem.
TO use ToA or TDoA ? We need to fetch the math solution this weekend. 
Bo would research this topic in this weekend.

#OFDM Audio Signal
##Work in plan
Also the combination of PSK and usual wave is critical in our paper. The PSK told us the information of distance, 
and doppler effect of usual wave gave us the motion information.
We need more work to prepare for it.
Shengjie would research this topic in the weekend.

#Double-Static Tracking
##Work in plan
Easy step if we get the PSK time difference.

#Single-Static-Single-Dynamic Tracking
##Work in plan
It would be major task in the next week.

#Double-Dynamic Tracking
##Work in plan
It would be mojor task in the next week as well.

Wish for a good luck in November.

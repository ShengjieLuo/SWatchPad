#Work Track in 11/13

##PSK Audio Singnal and Processing
###Work Have Done
* We have modulated simple waves into PSK waves of 3 different frequency options 
* we asked our classmates who major in System and Signals to get more infomation about OFDM\
* The distance measurement formula is finished.


###Work on Track
* _**[New!]**_ Bo has finished the hardware part. It's not perfect but it can work. 

###Work in plan
* Most problems had been solved. We would test it next Monday 11/14.\
* Bo will continue to complete the hardware in the next week

##OFDM Audio Signal
###Work Have Done
*  We have research the topic of FDM and OFDM. FDM would be easy, OFDM is difficult but within better effect. Both of two methods would be tested in the next week. Then, we would decide which one to be used finally.

###Work in Track
*  Shengjie would design the modulate-demodulate program this weekend.

###Work in plan
* The combination of PSK and usual wave is critical in our paper. The PSK told us the information of distance, 
and doppler effect of usual wave gave us the motion information.


##Static-Static Tracking
###Work in plan
Easy step if we get the PSK time difference.

##Static-Dynamic Tracking
###Work in plan
It would be major task in the next week.

##Dynamic-Dynamic Tracking
###Work in plan
It would be mojor task in the next week as well.

Wish for a good luck in November.

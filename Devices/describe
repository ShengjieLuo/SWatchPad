Because our device only has one mic, we add a mic on the top of the device and receive the sound by computer.
To reduce the time delay between computer and smartphone, use some application to control the smartphone on computer.
I have tried to use the smartphone which has two mic, but failed. 
It's hard to use two microphones to record different sound at the same device at the same time
I will try it again in the later days.
Distance measurement is similar to Alex Liu, L1=2.10cm, L2=11.95cm.
